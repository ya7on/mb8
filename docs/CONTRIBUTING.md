# Contributing

Thanks for checking out the project and wanting to help!

## Run the project locally
- Install Rust (stable toolchain is fine).
- Install `customasm` (steps are in `README.md`).
- Run `make run` to start the VM with the OS.

## Workflow tips
- Use conventional commits on `master` when you can.
- Before pushing, run `make ci` to check the code.

## What we need
- New features described in issues; if you have ideas, please open an issue first.
- Bug reports.
- Bug fixes.
- Tests (see coverage on Codecov).
- Improvements to existing code (opening an issue first is recommended).

## Final note
These are guidelines, not strict rules. If anything is unclear, let’s talk.
